# Advanced programming project - instant messaging service

We received an extension of time to submit the exercise on 20/5

How to run: Download all files and folders from GitHub to some folder, download node modules and the required libraries to work with React, then write in the terminal the command "npm start"

Folders:
1. public - The pictures folder and the main page index.html
2. src - chatScreen and homePage folders, other main files
3. src/chatScreen - All components of the chat screen
4. src/homePage - All components and help files of the registration and login screen

In this project we present the design and logical infrastructure for our instant messaging service without a server side.

* Home page - A screen to connect to the system will appear on the main screen, if the username and password are correct and exist in the system, you will be transferred directly to the chats screen. If you have not yet registered with our system, you can click on the link that will take you to our registration screen. 

* ChatScreen - On this screen you can add contacts as you wish using the dedicated button and chat with each contact, while we will save the content of the conversations with the other contacts. To select a specific contact you want to chat with, you can click on the contact from the list of contacts on the left, and the contact's details will appear at the top of the screen, and the last conversation with him will appear in the central part. In the top right corner of the screen, the logout button will appear which will take you to the home screen.
Also, your username will always appear above the contacts and to send messages or add people, you can use the enter key or the dedicated button.

Requirements for password: The password must contain at least 8 characters consisting of a combination of letters and numbers.
